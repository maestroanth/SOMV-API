/*Abstract Logic Mapping For Generator Design

    Set-up: Have an optional access token parameter

    Three Stages:

    Energy will be = to $$$ and subscribed users get more daily energy or whatever to use.
    Extra Universes can be deleted for a partial energy refund to help avoid bitching.

    Users can enter in any url request

    Stage 1:
    A 'pre'-diagnosis of the url will comeback with an energy cost. Most Universes will cost about some arbitrary amount
    of energy (say 10).

    If a 'rare' url is entered then the comeback with an energy cost will be higher, but it is still gamble that a rare
    Universe isn't a guarantee.

    For rare url's I can either hand pick a few, or have some parsing logic behind that determines the rarity. Currently
    I'm thinking the former to keep in a DB table of some sort to at least keep track of the super rares.

    The point is, I want the 'rare' url's to rotate from time to time on a daily to monthly rotation (maybe even to the hour).
    I can even automate this. This stuff I may keep secret.

    Stage 2:
    User can adjust the odds by spending more Energy. 

    Stage 3:
    I do want parsing logic mainly for determining the final stats after the 'base' universe is selected.

    And after that give the user some flexibility in further adjusting the stats or moves at the cost of energy. After each stat
    upgrade 
    there will also be a separate probability of 'screwing up' the fine tuning which will result in a "Faulty Universe" and they
    lose the Universe.  This probability gets higher as the more upgraded the Universe becomes.
    *I can have the sage's Intuition influence the probabilty*

    The user can pay energy to 'reverse time' and re-roll the "Faulty Universe".
    They can do this up to 5 times. I may decide to have the 5th time be auto-success or auto-failure.

    If Universes were really high and resulted in faulty universes, I'll probably make them redeemable for higher energy, but never
    as much as they originally spent. Or I can give 'mark' the faulty universe for a 2nd chance to rebuild it with all the upgrades
    at a cheaper energy cost or something.

    A good rare universe should cost around $5.  A good common around $1. I can make also super rare ones possible where the market can decide through online trades.

    I'd like to make super rare universe cards that can be worth $100's too that costs $1000's to make or hours of playtime...

    How To Build:
    Method 1 (Keyword strategy):
    1. Create a keyword table in the DB with FK's to universes.

    2. Write some string parsing logic that scans the URL string and tallies up keywords.



    3. From those tallies, assigns probabilities to say the top 6 or 7 Universes. Show only the top few as pre-diagnosis.
    *I can have how many shown based off sage's intelligence*

    4. For Stage 3 


    Method 2 (Hand-picking URLS):
    1.  I'll just start with the URL https://penzu.com/ (a diary website).  What I can do is make it a base greater chance to result
    in "An emotional Universe" combined with method 1 to add to that base vastly upping the odds for it to show up.

    Current Issues as of 11/24/2017
    1. The api calls aren't hugely reliable, depending on order of responses, sometimes it tallies up the data, sometimes it doesn't.
    2. FIXED the preflight calls after first use but resetting the headers!!!!
